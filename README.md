# prime-composite
An O(n/2) time complexity program that brute-forces whether a number of any size is prime or composite, capped only by how much memory the JVM memory has (thanks to the BigInteger wrapper). Brute-forcing is slow, but the class includes a stopwatch to display how long the calculation took.

Inspired by Frank Nelson Cole's work with the 67th Mersenne number, 2^67 - 1.

Enter the number in the console, then hit "enter" and calculation will carry out automatically.
